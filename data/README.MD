# Data

This folder contains two sub folders: **raw** and **preprocessed**. The original data should be placed into the raw folder. After that the preprocessing notebooks can be executed. After executing each notebook a new file will be generated in the preprocessed folder for each notebook. However, due to storage constraints and privacy, the data will not be uploaded to GitHub.
